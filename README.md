### Hi, I'm Jesse!

## Background

In 2007, at Georgia Perimeter College I took an intro geology course, and loved it. The concepts intrigued me and I wanted to learn more so, the next semester I enrolled in another. Fast-forward to 2014 and I'm living in Parachute, CO working nights on an oil rig, lookin' at rocks. A year or so later I moved with my wife and changed careers to work in environmental remediation. That didn't suit me so I took a few years to just enjoy living (working for a Spa company) in the beautiful Roaring Fork valley of central Colorado. When our son came along I quit my job and have been in search of a new career path ever since. That brings us to today, where I am enrolled in the Georgia Tech full-stack web developer bootcamp and am learning as much as I can between snack-time and nap-time. I am hoping to use this bootcamp as a learning launchpad and to begin a career in tech.
